# Bikepacking maps
Creating daily multipanel maps, elevation diagramms and summaries in one plot for a bikepacking trip from .gpx tracks. 
The project uses the R-Ecosystem while relying heavily on the packages: 
- sf for handling spatial vector data
- raster for handling spatial raster data
- ggplot2 to draw the beautiful multipanel graphics and its extensions for spatial data:
  - ggspatial
  - ggmap 

## Motivation
After a two months bikepacking trip from southern germany to the atlantic coast of portugal, I wanted to prepare a slideshow of photos ordered by date including a daily infographic
